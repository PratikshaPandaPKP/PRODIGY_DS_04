Here's a summary of the tasks performed:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn are imported.
2. **Loading and Displaying Data**: Training and validation datasets are loaded from CSV files and displayed to understand their structure.
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Missing values and duplicate rows are checked and handled.
   - Sentiment labels are checked for distribution and unique entities in the training set.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Sentiment distribution in both training and validation data is visualized using count plots.
   - Entity distribution in the training data is plotted.
   - Message length distribution is analyzed through histograms and box plots.
   - Word clouds are generated to visualize common terms in tweets for each sentiment category.
5. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Text preprocessing functions are defined to convert text to lowercase, remove special characters and numbers, and perform tokenization.
   - Preprocessed text is used to extract most frequent terms using CountVectorizer.
6. **Model Building**:
   - The target variable labels are adjusted, and TF-IDF vectorization is applied to the text data.
   - A logistic regression model is trained using a pipeline that includes TF-IDF vectorization.
7. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Model performance is evaluated on both the training and validation datasets using accuracy scores.
   - Confusion matrices are generated and visualized to understand the model's performance in predicting sentiment labels.

Overall, the tasks demonstrates a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis, including data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, text processing, model building, and evaluation.
